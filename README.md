For most features, i.e options a-l, the output can be found in edited.jpeg. For option g, the histogram will be output in histogram.txt. Option m will save to a file named ReverseSobel.jpeg.

Please refer to the user manual in docs/Project_Documentation_Noura_Zekry.pdf in case of any questions about input or output or obstacles while interacting with the features. The screenshots should be able to guide you through.

The environment must have the packages PIL and numpy in order for the program to run.
Any other package dependencies can be found in the import statements at the top of the file "project.py", most of which should be included within most python installations by default.
